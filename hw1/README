Homework 1 - Jack Diamond - 2/11/2020

This folder contains implementations of Stack, Queue, and singly LinkedList in Python3.

Methods for each implementation below.
Stack:
    empty
    push
    pop
    traverse
    find

Queue:
    empty
    enqueue
    dequeue
    traverse
    find
    
LinkedList:
    empty
    insert
    remove
    traverse
    find

Questions:

- Testing traverse on linked list after remove, also tested this in test_remove
- is file structure right?
- only one assert in each function?
- what are the differences between branch, condition, function, tests?
- run multiple files at once?
